Pitch for Project #2 03.27.2020
Ana Lucia Murillo

Anecdotal evidence shows that more Americans are fostering and adopting pets since the coronavirus pandemic began to spread. Using Google Trends data, I’d like to see how searches for “pet adoption,” and similar search terms are rising or not. From what I’ve seen so far, searches are up from a year ago. I can follow the trend over the next week or two.
I’m also curious to see if searches for those terms have peaked during or after other crises, such as hurricanes, when animals lose their homes.
I could reach out to people who have adopted pets since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, and to people who have adopted pets during other times of crisis for this story.

# Write your headline here

### Write your nutgraf here

Make sure your pitch answers the following questions:

- Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?
- What is the single question your story tries to answer?
- Why will this story resonate with your audience?

What else has been done on this topic (provide links)? How is your angle different or fresh?

- [Related headline (NYT)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/upshot/coronavirus-oil-prices-bond-yields-recession.html)
- [Related headline (NPR)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/upshot/coronavirus-oil-prices-bond-yields-recession.html)
- [Related headline (WNYC)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/upshot/coronavirus-oil-prices-bond-yields-recession.html)

Describe how and where you found the data with links to sources. Put the raw data (csv format) in a folder called `data` in this folder. Make a folder called `notebooks` where you will write your pandas code.

Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.

- Finding 1
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

Who are some potential human sources you could reach out to for more info?

What is the maximum (best) story possible? What's the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn't prove out?

## How to publish and submit your project

1. Make sure you have navigated to your `data-journalism` folder with your terminal first. Clone a fresh copy of this template and navigate to the folder.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:JOUR73351/pandas-project.git NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE
   cd NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE
   ```

2) Remove my git tracking from the project

   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```

3) Create a new repository on GitHub called `NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE` with the following settings.

4) Run these git commands to initialize the repo. Make sure you've checked `ssh`.

   ```
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/YOUR-REPO-HERE.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

5) Write your pitch in `README.md`.

6) Write your story in and add your assets and charts to `index.html`. Feel free to play around with and change the styles in `style.css`, but you are not required to. Delete the code that you don't need for your story. The story itself should be no less than 150 words and include at least one chart from Datawrapper. You can embed a Datawrapper chart in your story by copying the embed code into your html as I have done in `index.html.`

7) You can preview a local version of your story by running a python server.

   ```
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Before step 8, you must quit the python server by pressing `ctrl+c`.

8) To save a version of your story on GitHub, run the following git commands.

   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "YOUR-COMMIT-MESSAGE-HERE"
   git push
   ```

9) To publish, go to the settings of your GitHub repo, scroll down to GitHub Pages, and configure the source to the master branch.
